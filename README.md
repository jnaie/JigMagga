JigMagga
========

_JigMagga_ is a widget based configuration file driven frontend JavaScript MVC framework.

It uses all technologies of [bitovi JavaScript MVC](https://github.com/bitovi/javascriptmvc) ([canJS], [steal], [funcunit], [documentJS])
but replaces the core JavaScript MVC parts like the generator and the deployment by [Grunt] tasks or serverside workers.

Widgets in JigMagga are called jigs. They can be rendered in the frontend application and/or because of SEO reasons get prerendered on serverside. This can be decided in the configuration.

For styling there is a on the fly SASS compiler bundled.

JigMagga has it's own build in [Grunt] webserver, but can also be used with Apache.

For the deploy a [Grunt] task is used. It generates one merged and minified JS file and one CSS file.
 
The HTML is generated by workers that can be either called directly or be triggered by a [RabbitMQ].

All static files (HTML, JS, CSS and other assets) are stored to a CDN.

_JigMagga_ is build for SEO compatible multi language multi domain sites with a huge load.

Example configuration for generating pages
------------------------------------------

This is currently the workflow at all takeaway plattforms that use _JigMagga_.

It uses several queues and workers generating the different domains and pushing the pages to the CDN

Getting started
===============

_JigMagga_ is easy to install and works without any special environment but [nodeJS] and [git](http://git-scm.com/) if you want to update your local version. You can also download _JigMagga_ as a [ZIP file](https://github.com/yourdelivery/JigMagga/archive/master.zip).  
We didn't yet test in on windows, but this should also work.  
To run the [Grunt] processes easier, you can install grunt-cli globally (use sudo in debian and MacOS based system).

        npm install -g grunt-cli

Installation
------------

To install JigMagga clone the repository and run npm install

        git clone git@github.com:yourdelivery/JigMagga.git JigMagga
        cd JigMagga
        npm install
        
Start JigMagga
--------------

To start JigMagga webserver just type

        grunt connect
        
It should automatically open your browser. If it doesn't go to http://0.0.0.0:8000.

If you run it the first time it shows this file. After you created a project, it shows the first index page.
 
Generate projects, pages and jigs
=================================

To generate your project just call

        grunt generate
        
The generator will guide you through the generation of parts of your project.

Generating a new project
------------------------

To generate a project only a namespace is needed. Choose a short namespace, because this namespace Is not only used in the JavaScript code, but also in CSS and HTML. It will make your code longer. A two letter namespace is a good choice.

The generator will make a new project folder in the main _JigMagga_ folder. Inside the folder it will generate a new pages folder with a default domain folder and an index page folder and an index page.

As _JigMagga_ is config based, it creates config files in page folder and index folder. The project wide page configuration will contain the namespace. The page config contains an empty object for jigs.

The index HTML page will contain the call to the JS and over that to the config and some sections that use the _JigMagga_ grid.

After a project Is generated, grunt connect will call the new index page instead of this File.


Generating a domain
-------------------

When generating a domain you have to give the namespace and a domain name. The domain name can contain a slash if you want to group domains in folders. 

The generator will now generate the domain folder with the corresponding config file in the pages folder. 

Generating a page
-----------------

Generating a page also requests for the namespace and a name of the page. It also asks in which domain the page should get rendered.

If you want to group pages, you can use slashes to create folders.

The generated config file is empty. The generated JavaScript file just contains a steal of the config file. The HTML page contains sample HTML.

Generating a jig
----------------

To generate a Jig, the namespace, a jig name and a page to render the jig in is needed.
 
The generator will add the initial jig configuration in the selected page.
  
The generator generates a the initial jig and two pages to run the testcases. Also the initial testcase JavaScript file is generated.

Generating a model
------------------

Generating of a model only needs a namespace an a name for the model. It will generate a folder in the models folder, named as the model. In the folder there is an empty model JavasScript, a testcase JavaScript and a testcase HTML page.

Generating a locale
-------------------

Locales are generated by domain. The po files resist in the locales folder. Locales should be named in the form en_EN (lowercase language, uppercase country).

When generating a locale for a domain, the locale gets inserted in the domain config.

Generating a repository
-----------------------

When creating a project, the namespace folder is put into the gitignore file. With the generate repository option a project folder can be put into github as a repository.
