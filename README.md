JigMagga
========

_JigMagga_ is a widget based configuration file driven frontend JavaScript MVC framework.

It uses all technologies of [bitovi JavaScript MVC](https://github.com/bitovi/javascriptmvc) ([canJS], [steal], [funcunit], [documentJS])
but replaces the core JavaScript MVC parts like the generator and the deployment by [Grunt] tasks or serverside workers.

Widgets in JigMagga are called jigs. They can be rendered in the frontend application and/or because of SEO reasons get prerendered on serverside. This can be decided in the configuration.

For styling there is a on the fly SASS compiler bundled.

JigMagga has it's own build in [Grunt] webserver, but can also be used with Apache.

For the deploy a [Grunt] task is used. It generates one merged and minified JS file and one CSS file.
 
The HTML is generated by workers that can be either called directly or be triggered by a [RabbitMQ].

All static files (HTML, JS, CSS and other assets) are stored to a CDN.

_JigMagga_ is build for SEO compatible multi language multi domain sites with a huge load.

Example configuration for generating pages
------------------------------------------

This is currently the workflow at all takeaway plattforms that use _JigMagga_.

It uses several queues and workers generating the different domains and pushing the pages to the CDN

Getting started
===============

_JigMagga_ is easy to install and works without any special environment but [nodeJS] and [git](http://git-scm.com/) if you want to update your local version. You can also download _JigMagga_ as a [ZIP file](https://github.com/yourdelivery/JigMagga/archive/master.zip).  
We didn't yet test in on windows, but this should also work.  
To run the [Grunt] processes easier, you can install grunt-cli globally (use sudo in debian and MacOS based system).

        npm install -g grunt-cli

Installation
------------

To install JigMagga clone the repository and run npm install

        git clone git@github.com:yourdelivery/JigMagga.git JigMagga
        cd JigMagga
        npm install
        
Start JigMagga
--------------

To start JigMagga webserver just type

        grunt connect
        
It should automatically open your browser. If it doesn't go to http://0.0.0.0:8000.

If you run it the first time it shows this file. After you created a project, it shows the first index page.
 
Generate projects, pages and jigs
=================================

To generate your project just call

        grunt generate
        
The generator will guide you through the generation of parts of your project.
